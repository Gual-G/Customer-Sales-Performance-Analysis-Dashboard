 The goal of this project is to predict which customers are likely to return and generate positive
 revenue using machine learning. Additionally, descriptive analysis and visualizations are used to
 uncover actionable insights. 
It has three parts: Part one: data preprocessing
Part 2: Data vizualization
Part 3: LSTM Model to predict customer return behavior
